# Games-API
### Version 1.1

C# REST API with CRUD operations, deployed using Azure App Service. 
Developed for CS-432, Cloud Computing

## Version Specific Features
- Integrated Azure Key Vault and managed identity for improved security.

## Introduction

This API, inspired by [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/), is meant to catalogue and store Steam Games and relevant information about them. 
For stable builds look to version branches. The main branch is unstable and may be subject to changes.

## Getting Started
This section is if you want to deploy the Games-API on your own machine or Azure subscription.

### Running Locally

&emsp;In a new terminal:
``` func start ```

&emsp;Test with local route.
> **EX: http://localhost:7071/api/games**

### Deployment

&emsp;Create a Function App within Azure prior to deploying with desired settings.

&emsp;Navigate to the Azure Functions button in your local workspace and select 'Deploy to Azure'

> Your deployment domain will now be available on Azure. For instruction on testing go [here](#using-the-games-api).

### Setting Up Managed Identity and Key Vault

&emsp; In order to use your deployed API, a Key Vault containing your API key must be created, and the Function App must be granted access.
&emsp; The following steps outline the process, for further clarification look to [this video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b21EQvfjvHc&t=789s").
- Enable managed idenity in your Function App
- Create a Key Vault
- Give yourself Adiministatrative Access to your new Key Vault
- Create a Secret for your API Key
- Give the Key Vault Secrets User role assignment to your Function App
- Add a reference to the Key Vault in your Function App configuration
- Save your configuration and await confirmation from Azure
- Test your function app using your new API Key

## Using the Games-API

### URL

>**games-api-a0gveveefgdyfcap.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net**

### Authentication

To access the Games-API endpoints a valid authentication key must be presented.
